    \item[Problem 1]
        First, we have discussed in the class that the maximum
        size of this intersecting family is $2^{n-1}$ by pair
        each set and its complement.

        Suppose that there exists a intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$
        with size $2^{n-1}$ such that for some $A \subset B$, 
        $A \in \mathcal{F}$ but $B \not\in \mathcal{F}$.
        Since $A \subset B$, every set intersects $A$ that intersects
        $B$, $\mathcal{F} \cup \{B\}$ is also an intersecting
        family but its size would be greater than $2^{n-1}$,
        which is impossible. \#

    \item[Problem 2]
        ${10 \choose 3} = 120$, take every set from $2^{[12]}$
        which contains $1$ and $2$.

    \item[Problem 3]
        Take 5 sets with size 4: $\{1,2,3,4\}, \{2,3,4,5\},
        \{3,4,5,1\}, \{4,5,1,2\}, \{5,1,2,3\}$. The intersection
        between any two of them has size 3. Then there are
        6 elements remained in $[11]$ and $5 \times 6=30$.

    \item[Problem 4]
        $f(n) = 1$. The example for $m = 1$ can be constructed
        easily.

        \textbf{Proof:} by contradiction

        Let $a_i = 2^i$. Assume that $m>1$ sets are picked.
        Suppose $p$ is the largest element in
        $\cup_{i=1}^{m} A_m$ and $p \in A_k$.
        Since $\sum_{i=1}^{p-1} 2^i = 2^p - 1$. In order to satisfy
        the condition $|S(A_i) - S(A_k)| < 1$ for some $i$,
        $A_i$ must contain some elements larger than $p$,
        which violate the assumption. \#
