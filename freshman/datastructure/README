INTRODUCTION
------------

BEES(Beginner's Educational Emulation of STL) is my final project
for Data Structure Spring 2011. It contains my own implementations
to be a substitute for *list*, *vector*, *set* and *map* in *c++ stl*.

There are six modules in this project. For detailed usages you can
visit [here][document] to get an document.

  [document]: http://www.acm-project.org/doc/bees/1.1/

And you may need a technical documentation *BEES.pdf*.

DEMOSTRATION
------------

Just type "make test" (without quotes) you can see a test for this
code library. The codes of this test is in *main.cpp*.

IMPORTANT: gcc 4.4.0+ required.

FURTHER DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------

### For all ###

*  The iterator and constiterator are in JAVA STL style.
*  DO NOT remove an iterator twice, that will cause an exception.

### LinkedList ###

*  Using double linked list to implement this module.

### ArrayList ###

*  Just like *vector* in *c++ stl*.
*  You can assume that the length of the array is infinity as long as
   you have enough memory.

### TreeSet &amp; TreeMap ###

*  The implementation of this module is Size Balanced Tree.
*  It works FASTER than *set* and *map* in *c++ stl*!

### HashSet &amp; HashMap ###

*  Based on LinkedList.
*  The capacity do not mean the maximum of elements. You can assume
   that you can put infinity elements as long as you have enough memory.
*  You'd BETTER to choose a PRIME as the capacity.
*  The default capacity is 99971.
*  The capacity will not be modified after initialization.
